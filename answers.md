<b>Components of a DBMS (Database Management System):</b>

Database: A structured set of data stored electronically.
DBMS Engine: Manages access to the database and its data.
Schema: Defines the structure of the database.
Query Language: Allows users to retrieve and manipulate data.
Transaction Management: Ensures data integrity with ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
Security Management: Controls access to data.
Backup and Recovery: Provides mechanisms for data backup and restoration.
QUESTION 2
Relational Database: A relational database organizes data into tables (relations), where data points are organized into predefined categories represented by columns. Examples include:
MySQL
PostgreSQL
Oracle Database
Microsoft SQL Server
QUESTION 3
Classifications of SQL (Structured Query Language):

Data Definition Language (DDL): Defines database structure (e.g., CREATE, ALTER, DROP).
Data Manipulation Language (DML): Manipulates data (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
Data Control Language (DCL): Controls access to data (e.g., GRANT, REVOKE).
QUESTION 4
Primary Key vs. Foreign Key:

Primary Key: Uniquely identifies each record in a table and ensures no duplicate values. It must be unique and not null.
Foreign Key: Establishes a link between two tables. It refers to the primary key of another table and maintains referential integrity.
Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD): An ERD is a visual representation of entities (objects or concepts) within a system and the relationships between them. It uses standardized symbols to depict entities, attributes, and relationships.

 QUESTION 6
 Advantages of Relational Databases:

Data Integrity: Ensures accuracy and consistency of data.
Flexibility: Supports complex queries and relationships.
Scalability: Easily accommodates growing data and users.
Security: Provides robust access control mechanisms.
QUESTION 7
Types of Data Types used in tables:

Integer: Stores whole numbers (e.g., INT).
String (Character): Stores text (e.g., VARCHAR).
Date/Time: Stores date and time values (e.g., DATE, TIMESTAMP).
Boolean: Stores true/false values (e.g., BOOLEAN).
QUESTION 8
Purpose of a Database Management System (DBMS):

Data Organization: Manages the storage and organization of data.
Data Retrieval: Facilitates efficient retrieval of data through queries.
Data Security: Controls access to data to ensure confidentiality and integrity.
Data Integrity: Enforces rules to maintain accurate and consistent data.
Concurrency Control: Manages multiple users accessing data simultaneously.
