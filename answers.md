<b>Components of a DBMS (Database Management System):</b>

<p>Database: A structured set of data stored electronically.</p>
<p>DBMS Engine: Manages access to the database and its data.</p>
<p>Schema: Defines the structure of the database.</p>
<p>Query Language: Allows users to retrieve and manipulate data.</p>
<p>Transaction Management: Ensures data integrity with ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).</p>
<p>Security Management: Controls access to data.</p>
<p>Backup and Recovery: Provides mechanisms for data backup and restoration.</p>
<p>QUESTION 2</p>
<p>Relational Database: A relational database organizes data into tables (relations), where data points are organized into predefined categories represented by columns. Examples include:
MySQL
PostgreSQL
Oracle Database
Microsoft SQL Server</p>
<p>QUESTION 3
Classifications of SQL (Structured Query Language):</p>
<p>Data Definition Language (DDL): Defines database structure (e.g., CREATE, ALTER, DROP). </p>
<p>Data Manipulation Language (DML): Manipulates data (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).</p>
<p>Data Control Language (DCL): Controls access to data (e.g., GRANT, REVOKE).</p>
<p>QUESTION 4
Primary Key vs. Foreign Key:</p>
<p>Primary Key: Uniquely identifies each record in a table and ensures no duplicate values. It must be unique and not null.</p>
<p>Foreign Key: Establishes a link between two tables. It refers to the primary key of another table and maintains referential integrity.</p>
<p>Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD): An ERD is a visual representation of entities (objects or concepts) within a system and the relationships between them. It uses standardized symbols to depict entities, attributes, and relationships</p>
<p>QUESTION 6
 Advantages of Relational Databases:</p>
<p>Data Integrity: Ensures accuracy and consistency of data.</p>
<p>Flexibility: Supports complex queries and relationships.</p>
Scalability: Easily accommodates growing data and users.
<p>Security: Provides robust access control mechanisms. </p>
<p>QUESTION 7
Types of Data Types used in tables:</p>
<p>Integer: Stores whole numbers (e.g., INT).</p>
<p>String (Character): Stores text (e.g., VARCHAR).</p>
<p>Date/Time: Stores date and time values (e.g., DATE, TIMESTAMP).</p>
<p>Boolean: Stores true/false values (e.g., BOOLEAN).</p>
<p>QUESTION 8
Purpose of a Database Management System (DBMS):</p>
<p>Data Organization: Manages the storage and organization of data.</p>
<p>Data Retrieval: Facilitates efficient retrieval of data through queries.</p>
<p>Data Security: Controls access to data to ensure confidentiality and integrity.</p>
<p>Data Integrity: Enforces rules to maintain accurate and consistent data.</p>
Concurrency Control: Manages multiple users accessing data simultaneously.
